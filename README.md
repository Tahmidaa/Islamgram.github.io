ABSTRACT

ICT has brought many changes in human life. It has drawn the world closer as a global village with the introduction of social media. Social media has put both negative and positive impacts on people but plays a very vital role in exchanging ideas and sharing information. Social media has a significant positive impact on Islam if appropriately used, it can help to spread the cause of Allah (SWT) and put a positive impact on the ummah. Hence, for this intention, we have come up to build a social media platform ISLAMGRAM, where people can post only Islamic messages and spread the words of Allah and our Prophet (PBUH).

INTRODUCTION
For our project, a web application, ISLAMGRAM, has been developed. In today’s world, social media has taken over the youngsters as it’s a fun way to waste time and socialize with people. Therefore, we planned to make an app that will benefit the users by gaining Islamic knowledge from this app as well as interact with other users by following them. This app is for posting Islamic posts only, hence we named it ISLAMGRAM.

OBJECTIVE
To introduce to the society a new social media where they can post Islamic content only and benefit the Ummah. As we know, there are many social media but none of them are for Islamic content only, so we wanted to create something different and attract the users as we have many options in this web app.
